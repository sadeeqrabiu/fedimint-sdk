/// A running SDK instance: one [`Storage`], one BIP-39 seed, and every
/// federation joined against them.
///
/// `Sdk` is the root object an application builds once at startup (see
/// [`Sdk::builder`]) and keeps for the lifetime of the process. It is a
/// cheap handle over shared internal state: cloning it costs an atomic
/// refcount bump and every clone observes the same federations, the same
/// storage, and the same background work. On native targets it is `Send`
/// and `Sync`, so clones can be moved between threads and tasks freely; the
/// wasm build is the same type compiled for a single-threaded host, where
/// those bounds are trivially satisfied.
///
/// # One seed, many federations
///
/// An instance holds exactly one mnemonic. Each federation's client secret
/// is derived from it, domain-separated by federation id, using the scheme
/// documented on [`Mnemonic`] — so joining a second federation never
/// reuses the first federation's secret, and the same seed restored in
/// another fedimint client reproduces the same per-federation secrets.
/// Storage is likewise shared and namespaced per federation internally;
/// applications do not manage per-federation locations.
///
/// # Federation lifecycle
///
/// Every federation this instance's storage remembers is in exactly one of
/// the five states below, and every lifecycle call on this type is a
/// transition between them. They are worth reading once as a whole, because
/// the rest of this type's contract is stated in terms of them rather than
/// re-derived per method. ([`Forgotten`](FederationStatus::Forgotten) is the
/// one variant of [`FederationStatus`] that is not among them: it is a
/// notification that a federation is gone, not a state one is stored in.)
///
/// - **[`Running`](FederationStatus::Running)** — open, workers turning,
///   operations progressing, nothing the federation offers withheld.
/// - **[`Recovering`](FederationStatus::Recovering)** — open, with a live
///   handle, but its wallet has not finished being reconstructed from the
///   seed: its balance and activity are incomplete and every spend and
///   receive is refused with
///   [`Recovering`](crate::ErrorCode::Recovering) until the reconstruction
///   completes.
///
///   Those first two are the **open** states, and together they are exactly
///   what [`Sdk::federations`] lists and what [`Sdk::federation`] hands back
///   a live handle for. Completing the reconstruction turns `Recovering`
///   into `Running`, and nothing in this SDK completes or cancels one on
///   demand, so an unfinished reconstruction — and the refusals that come
///   with it — survives closing, reopening and restarting; the destructive
///   erase [`Sdk::forget_federation`] performs is the only way to be rid of
///   one without finishing it. Leaving the *state* is a weaker thing than
///   that: closing or quarantining a recovering federation moves it out of
///   `Recovering` while preserving the unfinished reconstruction, so
///   reopening lands it back here rather than in `Running`.
/// - **[`Quarantined`](FederationStatus::Quarantined)** — stored and
///   intact, but not running, because the SDK could not or would not
///   operate on it: its configuration is one this SDK refuses, its local
///   state could not be read, or no guardian answered when it was opened.
///   Nothing has been deleted, and the state carries the
///   [`ErrorCode`](crate::ErrorCode) and message that explain why.
/// - **[`Closed`](FederationStatus::Closed)** — stored and intact, not
///   running, because the application asked for exactly that with
///   [`Sdk::close_federation`].
/// - **[`Forgetting`](FederationStatus::Forgetting)** — an erase has been
///   committed and is being carried out, or is waiting to be finished by a
///   retry or by a later [`SdkBuilder::build`]; see
///   [`Sdk::forget_federation`]. This one is a dead end by design. The
///   federation is never opened again, never handed a handle and never
///   resurrected — [`Sdk::reopen_federation`] refuses it — and as far as
///   this API is concerned its balance, its history and its local state are
///   already gone. The only way out of this state is out of the storage
///   entirely.
///
/// Three rules hold across all of them, and they are what keep this from
/// being a pile of special cases:
///
/// **A stored federation is never silently absent.** [`Sdk::federations`]
/// lists the federations this instance has open — the two states above, the
/// ones with a live handle — which is what an application needs in order to
/// *act*. Everything the storage holds, whatever its state, is listed by
/// [`Sdk::stored_federations`], and [`Sdk::federation_status`] answers for a
/// single id. A wallet list should be rendered from the second, so that a
/// federation which is closed, quarantined, or being erased appears as
/// itself, with a reason, instead of as a wallet that quietly vanished
/// between two runs.
///
/// **No single federation takes the instance down with it.**
/// [`SdkBuilder::build`] fails only when the *root* storage or the seed is
/// unsound; a federation that cannot be opened is quarantined and reported,
/// because refusing to build would deny the user access to every healthy
/// federation and to [`Sdk::export_mnemonic`] — the one call that gets their
/// money out of a broken installation. A federation that will not finish
/// *being erased* is treated by the same rule: `build` attempts every
/// committed erase, and one that cannot be completed leaves that federation
/// in [`Forgetting`](FederationStatus::Forgetting), reported as such and
/// retried by a later build, rather than failing the instance. Anything
/// scoped to one federation is that federation's status; a top-level `Err`
/// is reserved for what makes the whole instance unsound.
///
/// **Getting a stored federation open again takes one call and no invite
/// code.** [`Sdk::reopen_federation`] moves a federation out of
/// [`Closed`](FederationStatus::Closed) or
/// [`Quarantined`](FederationStatus::Quarantined) using the configuration
/// the SDK already holds, into whichever open state its persisted work leaves
/// it in. An application must never have to have retained an invite code in
/// order to reach a wallet it still has.
///
/// Status changes are also observable as they happen, through
/// [`Sdk::federation_status_updates`], so an application can react to a
/// federation being quarantined underneath it instead of finding out by
/// provoking a failure.
///
/// # Durability: correctness never depends on a clean shutdown
///
/// Mobile operating systems terminate backgrounded applications without
/// warning, without unwinding, and without awaiting anything. A browser tab
/// disappears the same way. This design therefore takes the strongest
/// position it can and states it once, here, because several methods below
/// rely on it:
///
/// **Every transition an application can observe is durably committed before
/// it becomes observable.** A joined federation is persisted before
/// [`Sdk::join`] returns its handle. An operation is persisted before the
/// facade call that started it hands back an [`Operation`](crate::Operation).
/// A state is persisted before [`OperationUpdates::next`](crate::OperationUpdates::next)
/// yields it. An erase is committed before it begins. There is no window in
/// which the SDK has told the caller that value moved, or that a
/// fund-affecting transition happened, and could still forget it.
///
/// The consequence is that [`Sdk::shutdown`] is an optimisation, not a
/// correctness requirement, and that an abrupt kill loses nothing that was
/// acknowledged. What a caller may rely on after the process dies without
/// warning is spelled out on [`Sdk::shutdown`].
///
/// # Closed handles
///
/// Any [`Federation`] handle for a federation that is no longer running —
/// closed, quarantined, being erased — and every handle at all after
/// [`Sdk::shutdown`], fails its **fallible** calls with
/// [`ErrorCode::FederationClosed`](crate::ErrorCode::FederationClosed)
/// rather than panicking or silently doing nothing. Its infallible
/// accessors keep answering; see [`Federation`] for exactly what each of
/// them reports. The *reason* the federation stopped running is not encoded
/// in that error — one code covers all of them deliberately, so that
/// applications have exactly one "this handle is stale" branch — and is read
/// from [`Sdk::federation_status`] instead.
///
/// A [`Recovering`](FederationStatus::Recovering) federation is emphatically
/// *not* one of these. It is open, its handle is live, and the sends and
/// receives it will not perform yet fail with
/// [`Recovering`](crate::ErrorCode::Recovering) instead — a different code
/// because it is a different situation, and the distinction is the reason
/// both exist. `FederationClosed` says "this handle is stale, and no call on
/// it will ever work again"; `Recovering` says "this federation is working,
/// and will accept this call once its wallet has been reconstructed".
/// Retrying the first with the same handle is pointless; retrying the second
/// is the whole plan.

    ///    configuration, and never silently drops a module out from under a
    ///    facade an application is holding.
    /// 2. **The federation is quarantined, not closed and not erased.** Its
    ///    workers stop, it leaves [`Sdk::federations`], and its status
    ///    becomes
    ///    [`Quarantined`](FederationStatus::Quarantined) carrying

    ///    still there, so a federation that becomes supported again — the
    ///    guardians finish an upgrade, the application ships an SDK that
    ///    understands the new generation — comes back with
    ///    [`Sdk::reopen_federation`] and loses nothing.
    /// 3. **Pending work terminates observably, and is not thrown away.**
    ///    In-flight operation state is flushed durably first, and then every
    ///    outstanding
    ///    [`OperationUpdates::next`](crate::OperationUpdates::next) and
    ///    [`BalanceUpdates::next`](crate::BalanceUpdates::next) against the
    ///    federation resolves with
    ///    [`FederationClosed`](crate::ErrorCode::FederationClosed), as does
    ///    every subsequent fallible call on its handles. No subscriber is
    ///    left hanging — a promise that never settles is worse than a
    ///    failure, because a failure can be shown and retried. The
    ///    operations themselves are neither cancelled nor marked failed:
    ///    their persisted state is preserved verbatim and they resume where
    ///    they left off if the federation is reopened.
    ///
    /// Quarantine is deliberately loud, because step 3 means the SDK has
    /// stopped driving those state machines locally. Value already committed
    /// to a protocol will resolve however that protocol resolves it, with no
    /// local help until the federation runs again, which is precisely why

    /// [`Sdk::federation_status`] and

    /// is deliberately no cancel-recovery call — and it is why this call has
    /// to remain reachable on a recovering federation; see below.
    ///
    /// This ordering is required, not incidental. Checking eligibility
    /// against a federation that is still running would leave a window
    /// between the check and the erase in which a cloned facade — and every
    /// handle in this crate is cheaply cloneable, so an application may hold
    /// many — could start a payment, mint notes, or spawn a state machine.
    /// The erase would then delete the local record of value that had just
    /// moved. There is no way to close that window from the caller's side,
    /// so the SDK closes it: nothing can start work on a federation that is
    /// already retired.
    ///
    /// # 2. Refuse unless it is safe, leaving the data intact
    ///
    /// The call then refuses unless all of the following hold:
    ///
    /// - **Zero spendable balance.** Any remaining spendable ecash fails
    ///   the call with
    ///   [`BalanceNotEmpty`](crate::ErrorCode::BalanceNotEmpty).
    /// - **No non-final operations** and **no reclaimable outgoing value**
    ///   (out-of-band ecash a receiver has not redeemed and this instance
    ///   could still reclaim). Either fails the call with
    ///   [`PendingOperations`](crate::ErrorCode::PendingOperations).
    ///
    /// One class of non-final operation is deliberately exempt: an on-chain
    /// receive that has not yet seen a transaction. It holds no value — a
    /// deposit address with nothing sent to it protects nothing — and the
    /// only thing that could ever settle it is a stranger deciding to send
    /// money, so counting it would let a single unused address block the
    /// erase indefinitely. Once a transaction *has* been seen it is an
    /// ordinary pending operation and does block, until it is claimed or
    /// fails. See [`Onchain::receive`](crate::Onchain::receive).
    ///
    /// The reclaimable-value condition is the non-obvious one: notes handed
    /// out but not yet redeemed are still worth money to the sender until
    /// their reclaim window closes, and the record needed to reclaim them
    /// lives in exactly the state this call would delete. Incoming value
    /// still settling is guarded too, through the non-final rule rather
    /// than a condition of its own: a receive whose payment has arrived but
    /// has not yet been claimed is non-final, and the local receive keys its
    /// claim depends on are likewise state this call would delete.
    ///
    /// Every guard here is protecting value the caller **could still move**
    /// if they did something else first: spend the balance down, let an
    /// operation settle, reclaim the notes. That framing is what decides the
    /// next question.
    ///
    /// ## Recovery is never a reason to refuse
    ///
    /// A federation whose recovery has not completed is recovery-locked:
    /// every spend and receive against it is refused with
    /// [`Recovering`](crate::ErrorCode::Recovering), only a completed
    /// recovery releases the lock, and no call in this SDK stops or cancels
    /// a recovery. This erase is therefore the sole exit from a recovery that
    /// cannot be finished, and **none of the guards above may block it.**
    /// Concretely:
    ///
    /// - **A recovery-locked federation's balance does not count.** What
    ///   such a federation reports is a *provisional* figure that is still
    ///   moving as the rescan proceeds, and none of it is spendable —
    ///   spendable is what the guard is about, and the lock is precisely why
    ///   nothing is. Counting it would close the last door: the recovery
    ///   cannot be finished, the balance cannot be spent down, and so the
    ///   federation could never be erased either.
    /// - **The rescan is not a "pending operation" for this purpose.** A
    ///   rescan that is still going is a non-final operation, and one that
    ///   stopped short of completing holds the lock just as firmly. Neither
    ///   blocks this call, and phase 1 aborts a running rescan as part of the
    ///   erase.
    /// - **Reclaimable outgoing value on a locked federation does not block
    ///   it either**, because reclaiming is itself a spend and the lock
    ///   refuses it. Such value is forfeited by the erase, which is one of
    ///   the costs of this exit rather than a reason to deny it.
    ///
    /// So "no pending operations" must not be read as "not recovering", and
    /// this call never returns
    /// [`Recovering`](crate::ErrorCode::Recovering) under any circumstances.
    ///
    /// What that exit costs is real and should be put in front of the user
    /// before they take it: the recovered-so-far state is thrown away, the
    /// local activity history is gone for good, locally-recorded reclaimable
    /// value is forfeited, and starting over needs the invite code again. The
    /// federation still holds the funds, so a fresh join-and-recover can find
    /// them again — but it starts the recovery, and the lock, from the
    /// beginning.
    ///
    /// A refusal deletes nothing whatsoever. It does, however, leave the
    /// federation stopped — it was quiesced in phase 1, and handles are not
    /// revived — so its status afterwards is
    /// [`Closed`](FederationStatus::Closed) and
    /// [`Sdk::reopen_federation`] is how the application gets it running
    /// again. That is a deliberate trade: the alternative is to check first
    /// and quiesce afterwards, which reintroduces exactly the race phase 1
    /// exists to prevent. Losing a handle is recoverable in one call;
    /// deleting the record of in-flight value is not.
    ///
    /// # 3. Commit the erase before performing it
    ///
    /// "The deletion failed partway, and nothing records that it was meant
    /// to happen" is the outcome that must not exist. Such a federation is
    /// neither reopenable — doing so would resurrect a client whose state has
    /// holes in it — nor safely retryable, since nothing says what the
    /// half-deleted state was on its way to. Note that this is a statement
    /// about the missing *record*, not about the partial deletion: a
    /// half-finished erase whose decision is recorded is a perfectly
    /// well-defined state, and it is the third of the three below. So the
    /// erase is made atomic with respect to crashes and failures alike by
    /// committing the *decision* first. A durable tombstone is written in a
    /// single step, and only then is any state removed. From the moment the
    /// tombstone lands, the federation is gone as far as this API is
    /// concerned and the deletion is owed: this call finishes it, or a later
    /// [`Sdk::forget_federation`] with the same id resumes it, or the next
    /// [`SdkBuilder::build`] attempts it before the federation could be
    /// opened. A tombstoned federation is never opened, never handed a
    /// handle, and never resurrected, no matter how many of those attempts
    /// fail — [`Sdk::reopen_federation`] refuses it with
    /// [`InvalidInput`](crate::ErrorCode::InvalidInput), and a fresh
    /// [`Sdk::join`] of the same id finishes the erase first and then joins
    /// from nothing.
    ///
    /// What is *not* promised is a deadline. An erase whose completion keeps
    /// failing — a backend that will not delete, a file the platform is
    /// holding — stays committed and unfinished, and the federation sits in
    /// [`Forgetting`](FederationStatus::Forgetting), visible in
    /// [`Sdk::stored_federations`] and answering
    /// [`Sdk::federation_status`], until an attempt succeeds. That is the
    /// deliberate choice: a stalled erase is reported per federation rather
    /// than escalated into a failure of the whole instance, exactly as a
    /// federation that will not open is quarantined rather than sinking
    /// [`SdkBuilder::build`]. One undeletable federation must not lock a
    /// user out of the others, of their history, or of
    /// [`Sdk::export_mnemonic`].
    ///
    /// (A tombstone rather than a backend transaction because this crate has
    /// to make the same promise on two very different backends — see
    /// [`Storage`] — and a multi-key atomic delete cannot be assumed on
    /// both. A single atomic write can.)
    ///
    /// A federation is therefore always in exactly one of three states when
    /// this call returns, and there is no fourth:
    ///
    /// - **Erased.** `Ok(())`, the state is gone,
    ///   [`Sdk::federation_status`] returns `None`, and the id no longer
    ///   appears in [`Sdk::stored_federations`].
    /// - **Fully intact and closed.** The call refused in phase 2, or could
    ///   not even write the tombstone, and nothing was deleted.
    /// - **Committed but unfinished.** The tombstone landed and the erase
    ///   did not complete. The status is
    ///   [`Forgetting`](FederationStatus::Forgetting), so an application can
    ///   show "removing…" instead of a phantom wallet: the id is listed by
    ///   [`Sdk::stored_federations`] and answered by
    ///   [`Sdk::federation_status`], absent from [`Sdk::federations`] and
    ///   from [`Sdk::federation`], and refused by
    ///   [`Sdk::reopen_federation`]. The call is safely retryable with the
    ///   same id, and a later [`SdkBuilder::build`] retries it too.
    ///
    /// Forgetting is idempotent: an id with no local state is not an error,

    /// `Ok(())` — or, if it still cannot be finished, returns

    ///
    ///    *The location is created or found.* A native directory that cannot
    ///    be created, or is not readable and writable, fails with
    ///    [`Storage`](crate::ErrorCode::Storage). So does a browser origin
    ///    with no usable origin-private file system — a context that does not
    ///    provide one, or one where storage access is denied or refused by
    ///    the user. None of those can be known synchronously in a browser,
    ///    which is why they are reported by this `async` call rather than by
    ///    [`Storage::in_browser`].
    ///
    ///    *Then the single-opener lock is taken.* If the location is already
    ///    open — in this process or another, or in another tab, iframe or
    ///    worker of the same origin — the call fails with
    ///    [`StorageInUse`](crate::ErrorCode::StorageInUse) and nothing has
    ///    been touched. A lock left behind by a process that died without
    ///    [`Sdk::shutdown`] is reclaimed rather than treated as contention;
    ///    see [`Storage`] for the native and browser cases. (Sharing one
    ///    location between live processes is not part of the 0.1 contract;
    ///    see [`Storage`] for the future shape of that.)
    /// 2. **Reconcile the seed, before any mutation.** This is the step
    ///    where a wrong answer silently corrupts a wallet, so it is stated
    ///    exhaustively. There are exactly four cases:
    ///    - *The storage holds a usable seed.* It is used. If a different
    ///      mnemonic was supplied the call fails with
    ///      [`SeedMismatch`](crate::ErrorCode::SeedMismatch).
    ///    - *The storage is proven empty* — no seed and no state of any kind
    ///      belonging to this SDK: no federation record, no client state, no
    ///      operation log, no activity history. The supplied or freshly
    ///      generated mnemonic is written durably *now*, before any
    ///      federation-derived state can exist, so there is no crash window
    ///      that could leave state derived from a seed that was never saved.
    ///      Generating that mnemonic is itself fallible (see
    ///      [`Mnemonic::generate`]): if the platform's secure random source
    ///      fails, the call fails with
    ///      [`Entropy`](crate::ErrorCode::Entropy) and nothing has been
    ///      written.
    ///    - *There is no usable seed but there is other state.* The storage
    ///      is **orphaned**, and the call fails with
    ///      [`StorageOrphaned`](crate::ErrorCode::StorageOrphaned) without
    ///      writing anything, carrying
    ///      [`ErrorDetails::StorageOrphaned`](crate::ErrorDetails::StorageOrphaned)
    ///      with the location and `seed_present: false`.
    ///    - *The seed entry was read in full but is unusable* — truncated,
    ///      corrupt, or written in a format this build does not understand.
    ///      Also a refusal, with the same code and detail case but
    ///      `seed_present: true`, and again without writing anything. This
    ///      case requires the backend to have **returned** the bytes: a read
    ///      the backend failed to perform decides nothing about the seed and
    ///      fails with [`Storage`](crate::ErrorCode::Storage) instead, which
    ///      is retryable — a transient outage must not be reported under a
    ///      permanent code.
    ///
    ///    The last two cases are why "no seed" must never be read as "fresh
    ///    storage". Writing a new seed over storage that already holds
    ///    federation or client state would associate that state with the
    ///    wrong derivation root: every per-federation secret would be
    ///    derived from a seed that has nothing to do with the notes,
    ///    operations, and backups already sitting there. The wallet would
    ///    open, look empty or nearly so, and the real funds would be
    ///    unreachable without the original phrase — while the only local
    ///    trace of which seed the state belonged to had just been
    ///    overwritten. Refusing is recoverable; a wrong write is not. The
    ///    same applies to an unusable seed entry: it may be a newer on-disk
    ///    format an updated build could read, and overwriting it turns a
    ///    solvable problem into permanent fund loss.
    ///
    ///    **Ordering guarantee.** The emptiness proof and the seed
    ///    reconciliation happen under the lock taken in step 1 and strictly
    ///    before any write this call makes. If step 2 fails for any reason,
    ///    the backend is byte-identical to how it was found.
    /// 3. **Attempt every committed erase, and keep a failure to the one
    ///    federation.** A federation whose tombstone was written but whose
    ///    deletion did not complete (see [`Sdk::forget_federation`]) is
    ///    erased now, before it could be opened. A committed erase is never
    ///    resurrected, whatever the outcome of this step: step 4 does not
    ///    open a tombstoned federation and no handle is ever handed out for
    ///    one.
    ///
    ///    A deletion that fails here **does not fail this call.** That
    ///    federation stays [`Forgetting`](FederationStatus::Forgetting): it
    ///    is absent from [`Sdk::federations`] and [`Sdk::federation`],
    ///    present and labelled in [`Sdk::stored_federations`], answered as
    ///    `Some(Forgetting)` by [`Sdk::federation_status`], refused by
    ///    [`Sdk::reopen_federation`], and attempted again by the next build
    ///    or by another [`Sdk::forget_federation`] with the same id. The
    ///    reasoning is step 4's reasoning, applied to the same class of
    ///    problem: a single federation whose bytes will not go away must not
    ///    deny the user every other federation, all of their history, and
    ///    [`Sdk::export_mnemonic`]. So this call *attempts* to finish a
    ///    committed erase and reports the one it could not finish as that
    ///    federation's status — it does not promise that no `Forgetting`
    ///    federation exists once it returns.
    /// 4. **Reopen the federations, and quarantine the ones that will not
    ///    open.** Each federation the storage remembers, and that was not
    ///    closed with [`Sdk::close_federation`], is revalidated (including
    ///    the module-generation rule described on [`Sdk::join`]) and
    ///    started, and its unfinished operations resume from where they were
    ///    persisted.
    ///
    ///    A federation whose wallet was still being reconstructed from the
    ///    seed comes back [`Recovering`](FederationStatus::Recovering) — that
    ///    reconstruction is one of the unfinished operations that resume here
    ///    — and is listed by [`Sdk::federations`] alongside the
    ///    [`Running`](FederationStatus::Running) ones, since both are open.
    ///    That is how an application which persisted nothing across the
    ///    restart finds such a federation again, and why the list is defined
    ///    by having a live handle rather than by being fully usable.
    ///
    ///    A federation that cannot be opened **does not fail this call**. It
    ///    is put into [`Quarantined`](FederationStatus::Quarantined) with
    ///    the [`ErrorCode`](crate::ErrorCode) and message that explain why,
    ///    it is absent from [`Sdk::federations`], and it is present and
    ///    labelled in [`Sdk::stored_federations`]. Later builds retry it.
    ///
    ///    This is a deliberate reversal of the obvious design. Failing the
    ///    build is worse than it looks: one federation whose guardians are
    ///    down, or that has upgraded to a configuration this build refuses,
    ///    would deny the user every *healthy* federation, all of their
    ///    history, and [`Sdk::export_mnemonic`] — the call that gets their
    ///    seed out so they can reach their money with something else. A
    ///    single unreachable guardian set must not be indistinguishable from
    ///    a broken wallet. The original concern that motivated failing —
    ///    that an application would read a short [`Sdk::federations`] list
    ///    as "the user left that federation" — is answered by making the
    ///    federation *visible with a reason* instead of by refusing to
    ///    start.
    ///
    /// Top-level `Err` is therefore reserved for the root storage and the
    /// seed: things that make the whole instance unsound — steps 1 and 2.
