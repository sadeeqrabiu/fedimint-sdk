/// A running SDK instance: one [`Storage`], one BIP-39 seed, and every
/// federation joined against them.
///
/// `Sdk` is the root object an application builds once at startup (see
/// [`Sdk::builder`]) and keeps for the lifetime of the process. It is a
/// cheap handle over shared internal state: cloning it costs an atomic
/// refcount bump and every clone observes the same federations, the same
/// storage, and the same background work. It is `Send + Sync` on native
/// targets, so clones move between threads and tasks freely; wasm compiles the
/// same types for a single-threaded host, where those bounds are neither
/// available nor needed.
///
/// # One seed, many federations
///
/// An instance holds exactly one mnemonic. Each federation's client secret
/// is derived from it, domain-separated by federation id, using the scheme
/// documented on [`Mnemonic`], so joining a second federation never reuses
/// the first federation's secret, and the same seed restored elsewhere
/// reproduces the same per-federation secrets. Storage is likewise shared
/// and namespaced per federation internally; applications do not manage
/// per-federation locations.
///
/// # Federation lifecycle
///
/// Every federation this instance's storage remembers is in exactly one of
/// five states, and every lifecycle call on this type is a transition
/// between them. ([`Forgotten`](FederationStatus::Forgotten) is the one
/// [`FederationStatus`] variant that is not among them: it is a
/// notification that a federation is gone, not a state one is stored in.)
///
/// - **[`Running`](FederationStatus::Running)**: open, everything the
///   federation offers is available.
/// - **[`Recovering`](FederationStatus::Recovering)**: open, with a live
///   handle, but the wallet is still being reconstructed from the seed, so
///   its balance and activity are incomplete and every spend and receive is
///   refused with [`Recovering`](crate::ErrorCode::Recovering) until the
///   reconstruction completes.
///
///   These two are the **open** states: exactly what [`Sdk::federations`]
///   lists and what [`Sdk::federation`] hands back a live handle for.
///   Nothing in this SDK completes or cancels a reconstruction on demand,
///   so an unfinished one survives closing, reopening and restarting; the
///   destructive [`Sdk::forget_federation`] is the only way to be rid of
///   one without finishing it.
/// - **[`Quarantined`](FederationStatus::Quarantined)**: stored and intact,
///   but not running, because the SDK could not or would not operate on it
///   (a refused configuration, unreadable local state, or no guardian
///   answering). Nothing is deleted, and the state carries the
///   [`ErrorCode`](crate::ErrorCode) and message that explain why.
/// - **[`Closed`](FederationStatus::Closed)**: stored and intact, not
///   running, because the application asked for that with
///   [`Sdk::close_federation`].
/// - **[`Forgetting`](FederationStatus::Forgetting)**: an erase has been
///   committed and is being carried out, or is waiting to be finished by a
///   retry or a later [`SdkBuilder::build`]. The federation is never opened
///   again, never handed a handle, and its balance, history and local state
///   are already gone as far as this API is concerned. The only way out is
///   out of the storage entirely.
///
/// **A stored federation is never silently absent.** [`Sdk::federations`]
/// lists what this instance has open; [`Sdk::stored_federations`] lists
/// everything the storage holds, in whatever state, and
/// [`Sdk::federation_status`] answers for a single id. Build a wallet list
/// from the second, so a closed, quarantined, or being-erased federation
/// appears as itself, with a reason, instead of disappearing between two
/// runs.
///
/// **No single federation takes the instance down with it.**
/// [`SdkBuilder::build`] fails only when the root storage or the seed is
/// unsound. A federation that cannot be opened is quarantined and reported
/// instead, and a federation whose erase cannot be completed is left
/// [`Forgetting`](FederationStatus::Forgetting) and retried later, rather
/// than failing the whole instance.
///
/// **Getting a stored federation open again takes one call and no invite
/// code.** [`Sdk::reopen_federation`] moves a federation out of
/// [`Closed`](FederationStatus::Closed) or
/// [`Quarantined`](FederationStatus::Quarantined) using the configuration
/// the SDK already holds.
///
/// Status changes are observable as they happen, through
/// [`Sdk::federation_status_updates`].
///
/// # Durability
///
/// **Every transition an application can observe is durably committed
/// before it becomes observable.** A joined federation is persisted before
/// [`Sdk::join`] returns its handle, an operation before the call that
/// started it hands back an [`Operation`](crate::Operation), a state before
/// [`OperationUpdates::next`](crate::OperationUpdates::next) yields it, and
/// an erase before it begins. There is no window in which the SDK has told
/// the caller that value moved and could still forget it. Consequently
/// [`Sdk::shutdown`] is an optimisation, not a correctness requirement: an
/// abrupt kill loses nothing that was acknowledged. See [`Sdk::shutdown`]
/// for exactly what a caller may rely on after the process dies without
/// warning.
///
/// # Closed handles
///
/// Any [`Federation`] handle for a federation that is no longer running,
/// and every handle after [`Sdk::shutdown`], fails its **fallible** calls
/// with [`ErrorCode::FederationClosed`](crate::ErrorCode::FederationClosed)
/// rather than panicking or silently doing nothing. Its infallible
/// accessors keep answering; see [`Federation`] for what each of them
/// reports. The reason the federation stopped running is not encoded in
/// that error, one code covers all of them, and is read from
/// [`Sdk::federation_status`] instead.
///
/// A [`Recovering`](FederationStatus::Recovering) federation is not one of
/// these: its handle is live, and the sends and receives it will not
/// perform yet fail with [`Recovering`](crate::ErrorCode::Recovering)
/// instead. `FederationClosed` means this handle is stale and no call on it
/// will ever work again; `Recovering` means the federation is working and
/// will accept this call once its wallet has been reconstructed. Retrying
/// the first with the same handle is pointless; retrying the second is the
/// whole plan.

    /// - A rescan, running or stopped short of completing, does not block
    ///   as a pending operation; phase 1 aborts a running rescan as part of
    ///   the erase.

    ///   it either, and is forfeited by the erase.

    /// activity history is gone for good, locally-recorded reclaimable
    /// value is forfeited, and starting over needs the invite code again
    /// and restarts the recovery, and the lock, from the beginning.
    ///
    /// A refusal in this phase deletes nothing, but leaves the federation
    /// stopped, since it was quiesced in phase 1: its status afterwards is
    /// [`Closed`](FederationStatus::Closed), and

    /// again.

    /// [`InvalidInput`](crate::ErrorCode::InvalidInput), and a fresh
    /// [`Sdk::join`] of the same id finishes the erase first and then joins

    ///      storage is **orphaned**, and the call fails with
    ///      [`StorageOrphaned`](crate::ErrorCode::StorageOrphaned) without
    ///      writing anything, carrying
    ///      [`ErrorDetails::StorageOrphaned`](crate::ErrorDetails::StorageOrphaned)
    ///      with the location and `seed_present: false`.

    ///      corrupt, or in a format this build does not understand. Also a
    ///      refusal with the same code and detail case, but
    ///      `seed_present: true`, and again without writing anything. A

    ///
    ///    "No seed" must never be read as "fresh storage": writing a new

    ///    to. Refusing is recoverable; a wrong write is not.

    ///    lock taken in step 1 and strictly before any write this call
    ///    makes: if step 2 fails for any reason, the backend is
    ///    byte-identical to how it was found.
    /// 3. **Attempt every committed erase, and keep a failure to the one
    ///    federation.** A federation whose tombstone was written but whose
    ///    deletion did not complete (see [`Sdk::forget_federation`]) is
    ///    erased now, before it could be opened, and a committed erase is
    ///    never resurrected regardless of the outcome. A deletion that
    ///    fails here **does not fail this call**: that federation stays

    ///    attempted again by the next build or by another
    ///    [`Sdk::forget_federation`] with the same id.

    ///    open.** Each federation the storage remembers, that was not
    ///    closed with [`Sdk::close_federation`], is revalidated, including
    ///    the module-generation rule described on [`Sdk::join`], started,
