/// The persistent home of one SDK instance.
///
/// A `Storage` value names a place to persist everything an [`Sdk`](crate::Sdk) owns: the
/// seed phrase every federation secret is derived from, each joined federation's
/// configuration and client state, in-flight operations, and local activity history. Exactly
/// one `Storage` backs one [`Sdk`](crate::Sdk); federations are namespaced within it rather
/// than each getting their own location.
///
/// The concrete storage engine differs per target and is not part of the API: nothing about
/// the on-disk format is guaranteed, and it can change between releases without being a
/// breaking API change. Applications choose *where* to persist, never *how*.
///
/// # Choosing a constructor
///
/// - [`Storage::at`], persistent, native targets: takes a filesystem path.
/// - [`Storage::in_browser`], persistent, wasm targets: takes an origin-scoped namespace, not
///   a path.
/// - [`Storage::in_memory`], ephemeral, every target: takes nothing.
///
/// Each constructor exists only on the target it serves, so a wasm binding cannot reach for a
/// path-based API that could never work there, and a native build cannot reach for a
/// browser-only namespace.
///
/// # Construction describes a place; `build` opens it
///
/// Both persistent constructors only name a location and validate that name locally: no
/// directory or origin-private store is created, nothing is read or written, and no lock is
/// taken. [`SdkBuilder::build`](crate::SdkBuilder::build) is what actually opens the location,
/// creates it if needed, reads or establishes the seed, and reopens the instance's
/// federations; see that method for the exact order and the errors each step can produce.
///
/// # Seed and storage lifecycle
///
/// - A seed is written only when the backend holds no state of this SDK's at all: no seed, no
///   federation record, no client state, no operation log, no activity history. It is written
///   durably before any federation-derived state exists. A failure to generate one fails the
///   open with [`ErrorCode::Entropy`](crate::ErrorCode::Entropy), leaving the storage
///   untouched.
/// - Storage that holds other state but no readable seed is refused rather than silently
///   given a fresh one:
///   [`ErrorCode::StorageOrphaned`](crate::ErrorCode::StorageOrphaned), with
///   [`ErrorDetails::StorageOrphaned`](crate::ErrorDetails::StorageOrphaned) naming the
///   location, and nothing is written. Writing a fresh seed there would bind existing state to
///   a derivation root it did not come from: the wallet would open, appear empty, and the
///   real funds would be unreachable.
/// - Opening storage that already holds a usable seed with a different mnemonic is refused
///   with [`ErrorCode::SeedMismatch`](crate::ErrorCode::SeedMismatch), before any mutation.
/// - A federation that fails to reopen is quarantined and reported through
///   [`Sdk::stored_federations`](crate::Sdk::stored_federations) and
///   [`Sdk::federation_status`](crate::Sdk::federation_status) rather than hidden or treated
///   as fatal to the whole open: a short list from
///   [`Sdk::federations`](crate::Sdk::federations) never means a federation was silently
///   dropped, and one broken federation never blocks access to the healthy ones or to
///   [`Sdk::export_mnemonic`](crate::Sdk::export_mnemonic).
///
/// # One opener at a time
///
/// A location can be open in only one place at a time. Opening a location that is already
/// open, by another [`Sdk`](crate::Sdk) in this process, by another process, or by another
/// browser tab or worker, fails with
/// [`ErrorCode::StorageInUse`](crate::ErrorCode::StorageInUse), with no override: two writers
/// over one wallet's state could corrupt it and double-spend notes. The lock
/// is taken when [`SdkBuilder::build`](crate::SdkBuilder::build) opens the storage and
/// released by [`Sdk::shutdown`](crate::Sdk::shutdown) or when the last handle to the instance
/// is dropped.
///
/// A lock left behind by a process that died is reclaimed by the next opener rather than left
/// stuck: `StorageInUse` always means genuinely concurrent use, never a stale marker. This
/// protects against concurrent use of one location, not against a second copy of the data:
/// copying a location's contents elsewhere and opening both is the same mistake as restoring
/// one wallet's backup onto two devices, and the SDK cannot detect it.
///
/// In the same process, dropping or shutting down an [`Sdk`](crate::Sdk) is not by itself enough
/// to make its location reopenable: the underlying store stays open until every
/// [`Federation`](crate::Federation) handle over it has also been dropped, so a
/// [`SdkBuilder::build`](crate::SdkBuilder::build) against that location started before that
/// point is left waiting on it rather than failing outright.
///
/// # Durability
///
/// Everything a caller can observe is durably committed before it becomes observable, so an
/// abrupt process death loses nothing that was acknowledged; see [`Sdk`](crate::Sdk) and
/// [`Sdk::shutdown`](crate::Sdk::shutdown) for what that promises and what a clean shutdown
/// adds. "Durable" means durable as far as the platform allows: a native location lives until
/// something deletes it, while a browser store can be discarded by the user or by the browser
/// under storage pressure, see [`Storage::in_browser`].
///
/// # Current limitations
///
/// The persisted seed is not encrypted at rest; it is stored the way the backend stores
/// everything else. Protecting a copy the application has already exported is the
/// application's own responsibility, see [`Mnemonic`](crate::Mnemonic).
