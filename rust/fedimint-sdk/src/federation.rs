/// A handle to one federation this SDK instance has joined.
///
/// Everything an application does with a federation goes through this type:
/// reading its identity and balance, obtaining the [ecash](Federation::ecash),
/// [lightning](Federation::lightning) and [on-chain](Federation::onchain)
/// facades, reading [metadata](Federation::meta), reattaching to a running
/// [operation](Federation::operation), and paging through local
/// [activity](Federation::activity).
///
/// Like the other handles in this crate it is a cheap clone over shared
/// state: every clone talks to the same running federation client, and it
/// is `Send + Sync` on native targets, with the same types compiled for a
/// single-threaded host on wasm.
///
/// A handle keeps working until the federation is closed with
/// [`Sdk::close_federation`](crate::Sdk::close_federation), erased with
/// [`Sdk::forget_federation`](crate::Sdk::forget_federation), or the whole
/// instance is shut down. An application holding a stale handle degrades
/// into a reportable error rather than a crash: nothing here panics after a
/// close.
///
/// # What a closed handle does
///
/// "Fails with
/// [`FederationClosed`](crate::ErrorCode::FederationClosed)" applies to the
/// **fallible** calls: [`balance`](Federation::balance),
/// [`operation`](Federation::operation),
/// [`activity`](Federation::activity), [`backup`](Federation::backup), and
/// every call made through a facade. The rest of this type returns plain
/// values and has no way to report a failure, so each has a defined closed
/// behaviour instead:
///
/// - **The descriptive accessors keep answering.**
///   [`id`](Federation::id), [`name`](Federation::name),
///   [`network`](Federation::network),
///   [`invite_code`](Federation::invite_code) and
///   [`capabilities`](Federation::capabilities) go on returning the
///   configuration last known for this federation. A history screen can
///   still label rows with a federation that has been closed underneath it.
/// - **The facade accessors keep returning `Some`.**
///   [`ecash`](Federation::ecash), [`lightning`](Federation::lightning) and
///   [`onchain`](Federation::onchain) return a facade whenever the
///   federation had that module, closed or not, and the failure surfaces
///   from the facade call as
///   [`FederationClosed`](crate::ErrorCode::FederationClosed). Returning
///   `None` instead would be a lie with a specific documented meaning:
///   "this federation has no mint module", and would make a closed
///   federation indistinguishable from one that never supported ecash at
///   all. [`meta`](Federation::meta), which is unconditional, behaves the
///   same way.
/// - **[`balance_updates`](Federation::balance_updates) still hands out a
///   subscriber**, whose very first
///   [`next`](BalanceUpdates::next) yields
///   [`FederationClosed`](crate::ErrorCode::FederationClosed). The error is
///   where a caller can act on it, rather than being swallowed by an
///   accessor that cannot return one.
