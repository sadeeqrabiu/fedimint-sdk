//! Seed-based wallet recovery.
//!
//! Recovery restores a wallet from the seed alone, by rescanning the federation's history for
//! what that seed owns. Its failure mode is silent fund loss if handled wrong, so this
//! module's contract is written to rule that out: a recovery either completes and the wallet
//! is restored, or it has not completed and the wallet is not spendable. There is no state in
//! between that is safe to spend from.
//!
//! # The recovery lock
//!
//! A federation whose recovery is **incomplete** is locked. Every ecash, lightning and
//! on-chain send and receive against it fails with
//! [`Recovering`](crate::ErrorCode::Recovering). Wherever else this crate says an action
//! is refused "while a recovery is in progress", this is the lock meant, and this section is
//! its authoritative definition.
//!
//! **Exactly one thing releases it: a recovery for that federation reaching
//! [`RecoveryState::Done`].** In particular:
//!
//! - A recovery that **stopped** ([`RecoveryState::Failed`]) does not release it. That state
//!   is final for the attempt, not for the wallet: the rescan is no longer running and the
//!   wallet is still incomplete, so it counts as a recovery in progress.
//! - Restarting the process does not release it. The lock lives in the federation's persisted
//!   state, so it survives a crash, an [`Sdk::shutdown`](crate::Sdk::shutdown), and a
//!   [`Sdk::close_federation`](crate::Sdk::close_federation) followed by
//!   [`Sdk::reopen_federation`](crate::Sdk::reopen_federation).
//! - There is no call that releases it directly: no "spend anyway", no "mark recovered". A
//!   payment funded from a note set that was never fully discovered could double-spend a note
//!   the rescan never reached, so an incompletely restored wallet is never spendable.
//!
//! [`RecoveryState::is_complete`] is the predicate to gate fund-touching UI on.
//! [`OperationState::is_final`](crate::OperationState::is_final) is **not**: both `Done` and
//! `Failed` answer "will this state change again?" with yes, and using that to decide whether
//! the wallet is usable is exactly the mistake this section exists to prevent.
//!
//! If the lock is unacceptable to keep waiting on, the way out is the erase path below, not a
//! release.
//!
//! # Getting back to a recovery
//!
//! [`Sdk::recover`] is the entry point for a federation this instance has not joined yet: it
//! joins and starts the recovery in one call, and like [`Sdk::join`](crate::Sdk::join) it
//! refuses an already-joined federation with
//! [`AlreadyJoined`](crate::ErrorCode::AlreadyJoined). It is therefore usable only once per
//! federation and is not the way back to a recovery that stopped.
//!
//! Two entry points cover everything after that first call, and neither needs the invite code
//! again:
//!
//! - [`Sdk::recovery_status`] reads where a federation's recovery stands. It starts nothing
//!   and contacts no guardian, and reports "this federation was never recovered" as an
//!   ordinary `None` rather than an error.
//! - [`Sdk::resume_recovery`] returns a live [`Recovery`] for a federation this instance
//!   already holds, resuming a running attempt or starting a fresh one if the last attempt
//!   stopped. This is the retry [`RecoveryState::Failed`] tells the caller to make.
//!
//! Three ways to reattach after a restart, in order of what the application kept:
//!
//! 1. **It kept the [`OperationId`](crate::OperationId).**
//!    [`Federation::operation`](crate::Federation::operation) then
//!    [`AnyOperation::as_recovery`] gives back the typed handle, to that attempt specifically.
//!    If it reads [`RecoveryState::Failed`], a newer attempt may already be running under a
//!    different id (see the next section), so check [`Sdk::recovery_status`] before
//!    concluding the recovery is stuck.
//! 2. **It kept only the [`FederationId`].** [`Sdk::recovery_status`] to read the state,
//!    [`Sdk::resume_recovery`] to get a handle back.
//! 3. **It kept nothing.** [`Sdk::stored_federations`](crate::Sdk::stored_federations) is the
//!    list to start from, not [`Sdk::federations`](crate::Sdk::federations), which lists only
//!    federations currently open. A still-recovering federation is open and appears in both,
//!    and case 2 applies to it directly. A federation closed with
//!    [`Sdk::close_federation`](crate::Sdk::close_federation), and one left quarantined by a
//!    [`Sdk::recover`] call whose join committed but whose open then failed (see that
//!    method), appear only in the stored list, labelled;
//!    [`Sdk::reopen_federation`](crate::Sdk::reopen_federation) brings either back, still
//!    recovery-locked, before case 2 applies.
//!
//! # Reopening restarts a stopped attempt by itself
//!
//! Opening a federation whose last recorded attempt is [`RecoveryState::Failed`] resumes the
//! rescan automatically, whether the open came from
//! [`Sdk::reopen_federation`](crate::Sdk::reopen_federation) or from
//! [`SdkBuilder::build`](crate::SdkBuilder::build) bringing up open federations at startup.
//! The new attempt gets a new [`OperationId`](crate::OperationId), exactly as
//! [`Sdk::resume_recovery`] would produce, and [`Sdk::recovery_status`] is updated to point at
//! it before the open finishes. The stopped attempt stays in the operation log, untouched.
//!
//! `Failed` therefore describes one attempt, never a promise that nothing is running now:
//! after any reopen, the state to trust is [`Sdk::recovery_status`]'s, and
//! [`Sdk::resume_recovery`] then reattaches to whatever attempt is actually current rather
//! than starting another.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use fedimint_sdk::{FederationId, RecoveryState, Sdk};
//!
//! /// Makes sure this federation's wallet is restored, retrying a recovery
//! /// that stopped, and reports whether it ended up complete.
//! async fn ensure_restored(sdk: &Sdk, id: &FederationId) -> fedimint_sdk::Result<bool> {
//!     match sdk.recovery_status(id).await? {
//!         // Never recovered here, so never locked: an ordinary federation.
//!         None => Ok(true),
//!         // Done. The lock is released and spends work.
//!         Some(state) if state.is_complete() => Ok(true),
//!         // Running or stopped, either way the federation is locked, and
//!         // either way this hands back a handle to watch, starting a fresh
//!         // attempt if the last one stopped.
//!         Some(_) => {
//!             let recovery = sdk.resume_recovery(id).await?;
//!             let mut updates = recovery.progress.updates();
//!             while let Some(state) = updates.next().await? {
//!                 if let RecoveryState::Failed { reason, .. } = &state {
//!                     // Still locked. Retry, or take the erase path.
//!                     println!("recovery stopped: {reason}");
//!                 }
//!             }
//!             Ok(recovery.progress.state().await?.is_complete())
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! // Compiled, never called: running it needs a live federation.
//! fn main() {
//!     let _ = ensure_restored;
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # When a recovery cannot be finished
//!
//! A retry that keeps stopping needs an exit, and because the lock is never released on an
//! incomplete wallet, the only exit is to throw the incomplete wallet away: erase the
//! federation's local state with
//! [`Sdk::forget_federation`](crate::Sdk::forget_federation), the destructive half of leaving
//! a federation, then join it again from the invite code with [`Sdk::recover`], which starts
//! the recovery over from nothing.
//!
//! What that costs, stated plainly:
//!
//! - **The invite code is needed again.** Erasing the federation erases its configuration
//!   too, so an application that offers this path must have kept the invite code, or be able
//!   to ask the user for it.
//! - **Local history does not come back.** Activity history is local-only and a restore
//!   reconstructs spendable value, not a narrative, see
//!   [`ActivityItem`](crate::ActivityItem). Erasing it is permanent.
//! - **It is not a shortcut to a usable wallet.** The fresh recovery locks the federation
//!   again until it reaches `Done`. This path replaces one incomplete attempt with a clean
//!   one; it does not lift the invariant.
//! - **Value the local state alone could have reclaimed is forfeited.** Out-of-band notes
//!   this instance handed out and could still have reclaimed are recorded only locally, so
//!   erasing that record gives up the reclaim.
