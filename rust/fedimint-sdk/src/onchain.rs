///
/// - **Whole satoshis.** The amount that arrives at a withdrawal's
///   destination ([`OnchainQuote::amount`], [`Onchain::quote`]'s `amount`
///   argument, [`OnchainSendDetails::amount`]) and the gross amount a
///   deposit transaction pays in ([`OnchainReceiveState::Claimed`],
///   [`OnchainReceiveDetails::gross_deposited`]). Bitcoin has no sub-satoshi
///   unit, so these genuinely are whole satoshis.
/// - **Exact millisatoshis.** Every fee, every total debit, and the net
///   amount a deposit credits to the balance ([`OnchainQuote::fee`],
///   [`OnchainQuote::total`], [`OnchainSendDetails::total`],
///   [`OnchainReceiveState::Claimed`],
///   [`OnchainReceiveDetails::net_credit`]). A withdrawal's cost is more
///   than the chain fee for the destination output, and a deposit's cost is
///   a federation fee taken out of what arrives, so these sums are
///   routinely not whole satoshis.
///
/// No conversion happens behind a caller's back. Moving between the two
/// units is always explicit: [`Sats::to_amount`](crate::Sats::to_amount)
/// upward, which is exact (one satoshi is exactly 1000 msat), and
/// [`Amount::to_sats_exact`](crate::Amount::to_sats_exact) downward, which
/// refuses rather than truncates.
///
/// # The recovery lock applies to both directions
///
/// Every call on this facade, deposits as much as withdrawals, is refused
/// with [`Recovering`](crate::ErrorCode::Recovering) while this federation's
/// recovery is incomplete. An attempt that stopped short holds the lock
/// exactly as firmly as one still in progress, and only a recovery that
/// reaches completion releases it. There is no acknowledge, no override, and
/// no way to spend or receive on a partially restored wallet.
// Implementation notes (delete once implemented):
// - Both the `v1` and `walletv2` `send_fee_quote` are millisatoshi-denominated, which is
//   why the fee and total accessors on this facade return `Amount` rather than `Sats`.

/// [`Claimed`](Self::Claimed) carries the funding transaction, the gross

/// deposit by id, after a restart, from an activity row, or from a
/// notification, may see [`Claimed`](Self::Claimed) as the very first state
/// it is ever shown, and it can render a full receipt from that state alone.
///
/// The one state that is deliberately not self-contained is
/// [`Failed`](Self::Failed), which carries only a diagnostic reason even
/// though a deposit can fail after its transaction was seen. That is what
/// [`OnchainReceiveDetails`] is for: the address, and the transaction and
/// gross amount once one was seen, are on the details record too, so an
/// application never needs to have observed an earlier state to describe a
/// failed deposit.
// Implementation notes (delete once implemented):
//
// This follows upstream `fedimint-wallet-client`'s `DepositStateV2` variant for variant,
// but not payload for payload, on the `v1` wallet module. Under `walletv2` there is no
// per-address state machine to follow: the chain-side phases here are the SDK's own
// observation of the address, and the module's claim machine lands on them as `Funding` ->
// `Confirmed`, `Success` -> `Claimed`, `Aborted` (claim stays claimable, retried under the
// same operation id) -> stays `Confirmed`.
//
// - Only the transaction half of the outpoint is carried; upstream's `v1` variants also
//   carry the vout, which nothing in this API needs.
// - Every state that knows the gross amount reports it (`WaitingForConfirmation`,
//   `Confirmed`, `Claimed`), unlike upstream `v1` which only ever names it
//   `btc_deposited`.
// - `Claimed` additionally reports a net credit this SDK computes; upstream reports only
//   the gross figure.
