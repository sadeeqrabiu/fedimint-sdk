/// Obtained from [`Federation::onchain`](crate::Federation::onchain), which
/// returns `None` when the federation has no wallet module.
///
/// # Units: [`Sats`] for what moves on chain, [`Amount`] for what it costs
///
/// This facade mixes the two money types, and the split is not arbitrary: a
/// value is [`Sats`](crate::Sats) when it is a figure that exists on the
/// Bitcoin chain, and [`Amount`](crate::Amount) when it is a figure that
/// exists inside the federation.
///
/// - **Whole satoshis.** The amount that arrives at a withdrawal's
///   destination ([`OnchainQuote::amount`], [`Onchain::quote`]'s `amount`
///   argument, [`OnchainSendDetails::amount`]) and the gross amount a
///   deposit transaction pays in ([`OnchainReceiveState::Claimed`],
///   [`OnchainReceiveDetails::gross_deposited`]). Bitcoin has no
///   sub-satoshi unit, so these genuinely are whole satoshis; typing them
///   as [`Amount`](crate::Amount) would invite a remainder that cannot
///   exist and force every call to decide what to do with it.
/// - **Exact millisatoshis.** Every fee, every total debit, and the net
///   amount a deposit credits to the balance
///   ([`OnchainQuote::fee`], [`OnchainQuote::total`],
///   [`OnchainSendDetails::total`],
///   [`OnchainReceiveState::Claimed`],
///   [`OnchainReceiveDetails::net_credit`]). A peg-out's cost is not just
///   the chain fee for the wallet output: it also covers funding that
///   output from the primary (mint) module and the change and dust that
///   funding leaves behind, and a peg-in's cost is a federation fee taken
///   out of the deposit. Those are quoted and charged in millisatoshis, and
///   their sums are routinely not whole satoshis.
///
/// An earlier draft of this facade declared **everything** here to be whole
/// satoshis. That rule was written before upstream's fee contract was
/// checked, and it does not survive the check: both the v1 and the v2
/// `send_fee_quote` are millisatoshi-denominated, so the rule could only
/// have been honoured by rounding a fee — which understates a debit on an
/// approval screen — or by discarding part of it. The rule is therefore
/// narrowed rather than kept: whole satoshis where a value truly is whole
/// satoshis, exact millisatoshis everywhere a fee is involved.
///
/// What has not changed is that no conversion happens behind a caller's
/// back. Nothing in this facade floors, and moving between the two units is
/// always explicit — [`Sats::to_amount`](crate::Sats::to_amount) upward
/// (exact by construction, one satoshi being exactly 1000 msat) and
/// [`Amount::to_sats_exact`](crate::Amount::to_sats_exact) downward, which
/// refuses rather than truncates.
///
/// # The recovery lock applies to both directions
///
/// Every call on this facade — deposits as much as withdrawals — is refused
/// with [`Recovering`](crate::ErrorCode::Recovering) while this
/// federation's recovery is **incomplete**. "Incomplete" is the operative
/// word and it is wider than "running": an attempt that stopped short holds
/// the lock exactly as firmly as one still in progress, and only a recovery
/// that reaches completion releases it. There is no acknowledge, no
/// override, and no way to spend or receive on a partially restored wallet.

    /// [`Sdk::forget_federation`](crate::Sdk::forget_federation) refuses

/// The lifecycle of an on-chain deposit.
///
/// The five variants are the application-level lifecycle of a deposit —
/// nothing seen, seen, confirmed, credited, or could not be credited — and
/// both wallet module generations map onto them.
///
/// Under the second wallet module there is no per-address state machine to
/// follow: the chain-side phases,
/// [`WaitingForTransaction`](Self::WaitingForTransaction) through
/// [`Confirmed`](Self::Confirmed), are the SDK's own observation of the
/// address, and the module's claim machine lands on them as follows. Its
/// `Funding` is [`Confirmed`](Self::Confirmed), and its `Success` is
/// [`Claimed`](Self::Claimed). Its `Aborted` is **not** [`Failed`](Self::Failed):
/// an aborted claim leaves the output unspent and still claimable, and the
/// wallet client reprocesses it as a fresh claim of its own. The deposit
/// therefore stays [`Confirmed`](Self::Confirmed) across that retry, under
/// the same operation id whatever identity the underlying client gives each
/// attempt, until a claim succeeds. [`Failed`](Self::Failed) is terminal and
/// is emitted only once no further claim is possible, so an application
/// never sees a still-claimable deposit finalised — and never sees one pass
/// the guards on [`Sdk::forget_federation`](crate::Sdk::forget_federation).
///
/// Under the first, this follows upstream `fedimint-wallet-client`'s
/// `DepositStateV2` variant for variant, but not payload for payload.
/// Upstream's variants are `WaitingForTransaction`,
/// `WaitingForConfirmation { btc_deposited, btc_out_point }`,
/// `Confirmed { btc_deposited, btc_out_point }`,
/// `Claimed { btc_deposited, btc_out_point }`, and `Failed(String)` — note
/// that all three of the middle variants carry the same pair, not just
/// `WaitingForConfirmation`. This enum differs from that in three deliberate
/// ways:
///
/// - **Only the transaction half of the outpoint is carried.** Upstream
///   identifies the funding transaction by an outpoint; what is reported
///   here is its transaction half, which is what a receipt or a
///   block-explorer link needs. The vout is dropped because nothing in this
///   API takes one.
/// - **Every state that knows the gross amount reports it.** Upstream's
///   `btc_deposited` is the amount that arrived on chain, before anything
///   the federation charges to claim it, and it is available from the moment a
///   transaction is seen. It is therefore on
///   [`WaitingForConfirmation`](Self::WaitingForConfirmation),
///   [`Confirmed`](Self::Confirmed) and [`Claimed`](Self::Claimed) alike,
///   in whole [`Sats`](crate::Sats) — an on-chain output cannot hold a
///   fraction of one.
/// - **[`Claimed`](Self::Claimed) also reports a net figure this SDK
///   computes.** The amount actually credited to the balance — deposited
///   less the aggregate claim fee — is the number a user sees their balance
///   move by,
///   and upstream never reports it. It is an
///   [`Amount`](crate::Amount) rather than [`Sats`](crate::Sats) because
///   the fee is charged in millisatoshis and can leave the credit with
///   sub-satoshi precision; see the [unit note](Onchain).
///
/// # The final state is self-contained
///
/// [`Claimed`](Self::Claimed) carries the funding transaction, the gross
/// amount that arrived, and the net amount credited, and that is not
/// redundancy. A subscription yields the state an operation is in *now* and
/// never replays the ones before it, so an application that reattaches to a
/// deposit by id — after a restart, from an activity row, from a
/// notification — may see [`Claimed`](Self::Claimed) as the very first state
/// it is ever shown. If the final state named only the credit, that
/// application could not render a receipt at all: it never saw the txid, and
/// the gross amount was nowhere to be found. It now can, from the current
/// state alone.
///
/// The one state that is deliberately not self-contained is
/// [`Failed`](Self::Failed), which carries only a diagnostic reason even
/// though a deposit can fail after its transaction was seen. That is what
/// [`OnchainReceiveDetails`] is for: the address, and the transaction and
/// gross amount once one was seen, are on the details record too — a fee

///   arrived and then could not be claimed is precisely the one an
///   application has to be able to describe, so the record keeps what that

///   [`net_credit`](OnchainReceiveDetails::net_credit) are set when the
///   claim settles, in the write that records
