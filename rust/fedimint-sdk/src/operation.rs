//! The operation model: typed state machines observed from the outside.
//!
//! Everything the SDK does that takes longer than a single call — paying an
//! invoice, waiting for a deposit to confirm, redeeming ecash — is an
//! *operation*. An operation is created by a facade call, runs in the
//! background from that moment, is persisted as it goes, and reports its
//! progress as a sequence of states. This module defines the vocabulary
//! shared by all of them: the [`OperationState`] trait each state enum
//! implements, the [`Operation`] handle used to observe one, the
//! [`OperationUpdates`] subscriber that streams its transitions, the
//! type-erased [`AnyOperation`] returned when an operation is looked up by
//! id after a restart, and the [`OperationSupport`] answer that says how far
//! *this* build can go with such a record — which is not a property of the
//! record alone, because a build older than the schema a state was written
//! at can read the row and still not observe the operation.
//!
//! It also defines the half of an operation that is *not* a state: the
//! persisted [`OperationDetails`] record each kind keeps — the notes handed
//! out, the invoice issued, the address allocated, the fee and route of the
//! quote that was executed — read back through [`Operation::details`]. States
//! say where an operation has got to; details say what it is. Both are needed
//! to make good on the crate's promise that an operation id is all it takes
//! to pick an operation back up, because a subscription yields the current
//! state and never replays the ones before it. [`OperationDetails`] states
//! the rule for which of the two any given value belongs in, and that rule is
//! binding on every facade module in this crate.

///
/// The trait is sealed: the set of operation kinds is defined by this SDK

/// own sake — each state type is monomorphised into a concrete type in
/// every generated binding, so a state type the SDK does not know about
/// could not cross a foreign-function boundary at all. Adding a kind is an
/// additive change to this crate.
///
/// # Supertraits
///
/// `Clone` because states are values handed out to every subscriber
/// independently; `Send + Sync + 'static` because operations are driven by
/// background tasks on native targets and their states cross task and
/// thread boundaries. Note that `Debug` is deliberately *not* required
/// here even though every concrete state enum implements it, so that the
/// bound stays minimal; the generic types in this module still print,
/// because their `Debug` impls apply whenever the state type happens to be
/// `Debug`.

    /// and will never transition again.

    /// A terminal state is not necessarily a *successful* one: a refunded
    /// lightning payment and an expired invoice are both final. This is the
    /// predicate [`Operation::await_final`] waits for and the point at
    /// which an [`OperationUpdates`] subscription closes.
    fn is_final(&self) -> bool;
}

/// The persisted, per-kind record of what an operation *is*, as opposed to
/// where it has got to.
///
/// Each kind of operation has its own record — `EcashSendDetails`,
/// `LnReceiveDetails`, `OnchainReceiveDetails`, and so on, each defined
/// beside the facade that creates that operation — and this trait is what
/// they have in common. It has no methods: a details record is plain data,
/// read field by field, and this trait exists to name the contract all of
/// them obey and to be the bound on [`DetailedOperationState::Details`].
/// Read one with [`Operation::details`].
///
/// # Why operations need this
///
/// This crate promises that an [`OperationId`] is all it takes to pick an
/// operation back up. Without a persisted record that promise is false, and
/// the gap is not a small one: the notes a sender must hand to a receiver,
/// the invoice a payee must show as a QR code, and the deposit address a
/// depositor must display exist only in the value the original facade call
/// returned. A [`Operation::updates`] subscription cannot recover them,
/// because it is not a replay — it yields the state the operation is in
/// *now*, and the artifact was never in a state to begin with. After a
/// restart the data needed to render or complete the operation would simply
/// be gone.
///
/// The other half of the same gap is the terms an operation was executed
/// on. A lightning fee and route are quoted once, do not appear in
/// upstream's progress stream at all, and must remain readable however the
/// payment ends — a refunded or failed send has a fee and a route just as a
/// successful one does, and a receipt that can only be produced for
/// successes is not a receipt.
///
/// # The placement rule
///
/// Every value an operation exposes belongs in exactly one of three places,
/// decided by asking when it comes into existence and how long it stays
/// readable. This rule is binding on every facade module in this crate.
///
/// 1. **Fixed when the operation is created, or when its quote was
///    executed → the details record, and only there.** The notes, the
///    invoice, the address, the destination, the resolved amounts, the fee
///    and route the quote committed to, the moment it started. None of it
///    ever changes, so none of it belongs in a stream of transitions:
///    putting it there would re-deliver the same bytes on every update, and
///    for a bearer instrument like [`Notes`](crate::Notes) it would copy
///    spendable value into every subscriber, every log line and every
///    `Debug` rendering of a state.
/// 2. **Comes into existence at a transition *and* is carried by every
///    state from then on, final states included → the state, and only
///    there.** A final state is sticky: it never transitions again, so
///    [`Operation::state`] returns it for the rest of time and anything on
///    it is already durable. The preimage of a successful lightning payment
///    is the example — it exists exactly when
///    [`LnSendState::Success`](crate::LnSendState::Success) does, and
///    copying it into the record would duplicate a value that can never be
///    missed.
/// 3. **Comes into existence at a transition but is *not* on every later
///    state → both.** The state announces it; the record keeps it. The
///    funding transaction a caller learns from
///    [`OnchainReceiveState::WaitingForConfirmation`](crate::OnchainReceiveState::WaitingForConfirmation)
///    is gone by
///    [`Claimed`](crate::OnchainReceiveState::Claimed), and a lightning
///    send's fee and route appear only on success. These are exactly the
///    values that "subscriptions do not replay" turns into lost data, and
///    they are what an `Option` field on a record is for: absent until the
///    fact is established, then set once and never changed again.
///
/// The test to apply is a single sentence: **a caller must never need to
/// have seen an earlier state.** Whatever it takes to render or complete a
/// reattached operation, [`Operation::details`] and the current state must
/// supply between them. Case 3 is the only licence to duplicate a state's
/// payload, and it must be justified in the field's own documentation.
///
/// # What implementing this obliges an implementation to do
///
/// - **The record is committed before the creating call returns.** The
///   write that creates the operation writes its details, in the same
///   storage transaction. A process that dies immediately after
///   [`Ecash::send`](crate::Ecash::send) returns must still find the notes
///   on the next start; that is the whole point.
/// - **Fields fill in at most once and never move.** A field is either set
///   at creation or set in the same write that records the transition
///   establishing it. `None` becomes `Some` at most once — an optional fact
///   need never come to exist, and a record whose operation ended without
///   it keeps the `None` for good — and a value never changes to a
///   different value, and never reverts.
/// - **Nothing is derived at read time from a state that may have been
///   missed.** If a value can only be observed as a transition happens, it
///   is persisted as it happens.
/// - **No secrets beyond what the caller already holds.** A record may
///   carry the caller's own bearer artifacts (that is what makes it useful),
///   and never seed material.
///
/// # Supertraits, and the shape a binding sees
///
/// `Clone` because a record is a value handed out per call; `Send + Sync +
/// 'static` because it crosses the same task and thread boundaries as the
/// handle that produced it. Unlike [`OperationState`], `Debug` *is*
/// required: a details record is plain data whose purpose is to be rendered
/// and logged, every one of them derives it anyway under this crate's
/// `missing_debug_implementations` lint, and the types that must not appear
/// in a log redact their own `Debug` rather than relying on containers to
/// omit them (see [`Notes`](crate::Notes)).
///
/// Each record is a concrete, non-generic struct of plain owned fields — no
/// generics, no tuples, no borrowed data, no `impl Trait` — so it generates
/// into a Swift or Kotlin data class and a TypeScript interface
/// mechanically. [`Operation`] stays generic in Rust and the FFI layer
/// monomorphises it, which turns [`Operation::details`] into one method per
/// kind returning one concrete record.
///
/// # Sealed
///
/// Sealed for the same reason [`OperationState`] is: the set of operation
/// kinds, and therefore of details records, is this crate's to define, and a
/// record type the SDK does not know about could not cross a
/// foreign-function boundary at all.

/// abort anything, and neither does dropping an [`OperationUpdates`]
/// obtained from it — the only thing that ends an operation is the
/// operation reaching a final state. The same is true across restarts: an
/// operation is persisted as it progresses, resumes when the SDK is built
/// again over the same storage, and can be picked up again with
/// [`Federation::operation`](crate::Federation::operation).
///
/// That is a deliberate answer to "is this cancellable?": for most
/// operations there is nothing to cancel, because the money has already
/// moved into a protocol that will resolve one way or the other. Where a
/// cancellation genuinely exists, it is a named request on that specific
/// operation — see
/// [`Operation::<EcashSendState>::request_cancel`](crate::Operation::request_cancel) —
/// and its outcome arrives as a state, not as the return value of the
/// cancel call.
///
/// # What survives a restart, and where to read it
///
/// Two things, and it takes both to render a reattached operation:
///
/// - **The current state**, from [`state`](Operation::state) or
///   [`updates`](Operation::updates). This is where the operation has got
///   to. It is *not* a history: a subscription opened after the fact yields
///   the state now and never the states before it.
/// - **The persisted details**, from [`details`](Operation::details) — the
///   notes handed out, the invoice issued, the address allocated, the fee
///   and route of the quote that was executed. These are the facts that were
///   fixed when the operation was created and that no state carries.
///
/// So the full reattachment path is
/// [`Federation::operation`](crate::Federation::operation) by id, the
/// matching accessor on [`AnyOperation`] for a typed handle, then
/// `details()` and `state()` — and nothing else. An application never has to
/// have kept the value the original facade call returned, and never has to
/// have been watching. [`OperationDetails`] states which values live in
/// which of the two, and why.
///
/// # Failures are states, errors are not
///
/// A payment that fails, an invoice that expires, a deposit the federation
/// rejects: all of those are ordinary final *states*, reported as `Ok`. An
/// `Err` from any method here means something else went wrong — storage
/// could not be read, the federation could not be reached, the handle

///   kind is known but whose *state* this build cannot read still reports its
///   real kind: the discriminator was read and understood, and the row should
///   say what the record says rather than be degraded on the reader's
///   account.
/// - **"How far can this build go with it, and why no further?"** —
///   [`support`](AnyOperation::support). One of
///   [`OperationSupport`]'s variants: `Observable`, or which of the two
///   conditions failed. Infallible, so it is the form to log, show in a bug
///   report, or use to decide between "written by a newer version" and
///   "not recognised at all" in a message to a user.
/// - **"May I act on it, and what is it?"** —
///   [`supported_kind`](AnyOperation::supported_kind). `Ok(kind)` exactly when
///   [`support`](AnyOperation::support) is
///   [`Observable`](OperationSupport::Observable), and
///   [`UnsupportedOperation`](crate::ErrorCode::UnsupportedOperation)
///   otherwise. This is the gate to pass before doing anything with the
///   operation, and the one call in this crate that produces that code.
/// - **"What exactly was recorded?"** —
///   [`raw_kind`](AnyOperation::raw_kind). The persisted discriminator
///   verbatim, for logs and bug reports, so an application can say *which*
///   thing it did not understand instead of only that something was
///   unrecognised.
///
/// ## What `None` from an accessor means
///
/// The seven `as_*` accessors below answer one narrow question — "is it
/// *this* kind, and if so give me the handle" — and they return `Some` on
/// exactly the condition above: the kind matches *and*
/// [`support`](AnyOperation::support) is
/// [`Observable`](OperationSupport::Observable). So `None` covers three
/// situations, and deliberately does not distinguish them:
///
/// - it is a different kind — the ordinary mismatch;
/// - the record is one this build cannot interpret at all
///   ([`UnknownKind`](OperationSupport::UnknownKind));
/// - it *is* this kind, and this build still cannot observe it
///   ([`StateSchemaTooNew`](OperationSupport::StateSchemaTooNew)).
///
/// That third case is why the accessors are not merely a kind test. Handing
/// back a typed [`Operation`] whose state cannot be decoded would move the
/// failure to [`Operation::state`], one call after the caller stopped
/// checking; `None` keeps the whole question in one place. Which of the three
/// it was is available, once, from [`support`](AnyOperation::support) and
/// [`supported_kind`](AnyOperation::supported_kind), rather than making each
/// of seven accessors return a two-level answer that most callers would
/// unwrap twice for nothing. A caller that will act on the operation asks
/// first; a caller that is only sorting rows by kind never has to.
///
/// ## What no pre-read check can know
///
/// [`Observable`](OperationSupport::Observable) is everything that can be
/// established *before* the operation's state is read: a known kind, and a
/// recorded schema version this build reads. It
/// is not a promise that the read will succeed, and this type does not
/// pretend otherwise — the check sees a version number, not the bytes behind
/// it, and a record that carries no version at all
/// ([`schema_version`](RawOperationKind::schema_version) is `None`) offers
/// nothing to compare, so it is treated as not ruled out rather than as
/// ruled in.
///
/// What that buys is that every reason knowable in advance is reported in
/// advance, by one call, instead of surfacing as a surprise from a typed
/// handle the caller already holds. What is left over is the residue: a state
/// that passed both conditions and still cannot be decoded means a
/// producer wrote a schema version it did not honour, which is a bug on one
/// side or the other and not a forward-compatibility case. That surfaces as
/// [`Internal`](crate::ErrorCode::Internal) from
/// [`Operation::state`], never as
/// [`UnsupportedOperation`](crate::ErrorCode::UnsupportedOperation) — the
/// code keeps meaning "this build cannot interpret this operation", decided
/// once, at the gate.
