//! The operation model: background work observed from the outside.
//!
//! Everything the SDK does that takes longer than a single call, paying an
//! invoice, waiting for a deposit to confirm, redeeming ecash, is an
//! *operation*. An operation is created by a facade call, runs in the
//! background from that moment, is persisted as it goes, and reports its
//! progress as a sequence of states. This module defines the vocabulary
//! shared by all of them: the [`OperationState`] trait each state enum
//! implements, the [`Operation`] handle used to observe one, the
//! [`OperationUpdates`] subscriber that streams its transitions, the
//! type-erased [`AnyOperation`] returned when an operation is looked up by
//! id after a restart, and the [`OperationSupport`] answer that says how far
//! this build can go with such a record.
//!
//! It also defines the half of an operation that is not a state: the
//! persisted [`OperationDetails`] record each kind keeps, the notes handed
//! out, the invoice issued, the address allocated, the fee and route of the
//! quote that was executed, read back through [`Operation::details`]. States
//! say where an operation has got to; details say what it is. Both are needed
//! to make good on the promise that an operation id is all it takes to pick
//! an operation back up, because a subscription yields the current state and
//! never replays the ones before it.

/// # The placement rule
///
/// Every value an operation exposes belongs in exactly one of three places:
///
/// 1. **Fixed when the operation is created, or when its quote was
///    executed: the details record, and only there.** The notes, the
///    invoice, the address, the destination, the resolved amounts, the fee
///    and route the quote committed to, the moment it started. None of it
///    ever changes.
/// 2. **Set by a transition and carried by every state from then on, final
///    states included: the state, and only there.** The preimage of a
///    successful lightning payment is the example: it exists exactly when
///    [`LnSendState::Success`](crate::LnSendState::Success) does.
/// 3. **Set by a transition but not carried by every later state: both.**
///    The state announces it; the record keeps it. The funding transaction a
///    caller learns from
///    [`WaitingForConfirmation`](crate::OnchainReceiveState::WaitingForConfirmation)
///    is gone by [`Claimed`](crate::OnchainReceiveState::Claimed), and a
///    lightning send's fee and route appear only on success; these are
///    exactly the values an `Option` field on a record is for, absent until
///    the fact is established, then set once and never changed again.
///
/// A caller never needs to have seen an earlier state: whatever it takes to
/// render or complete a reattached operation, [`Operation::details`] and the
/// current state supply between them.
// The client's own operation log is authoritative for an operation's existence; this record is a
// decoration over it, written immediately after the module call returns and before the creating
// call hands back a handle. A crash in the gap between the two commits leaves a log entry with no
// record, repaired by reconciliation the next time the federation is opened. See below for why
// the two cannot be committed together.
// - Fields fill in at most once and never move: set at creation, or set in the same write that
//   records the transition establishing them. `None` becomes `Some` at most once and a value
//   never changes to a different value or reverts.
// - Nothing is derived at read time from a state that may have been missed; persist a value as
//   soon as it is observed.
// - No secrets beyond what the caller already holds: bearer artifacts the caller owns are fine,
//   seed material never belongs here.
// - `Debug` is a supertrait bound (unlike on `OperationState`) because every record derives it
//   under this crate's `missing_debug_implementations` lint; types that must not appear in a log
//   (see `Notes`) redact their own `Debug` instead of relying on a container to omit them.
//
// Fedimint does not let an embedder join the transaction the module commits its own operation
// log entry in: no module's creation method takes a `dbtx`, and the `_dbtx` variants that would
// allow it hang off `ClientContext`, which only a module implementation holds
// (fedimint-client-module/src/module/mod.rs:400, :662, :865). So the record is written
// immediately after the module call returns and before the creating call hands back a handle,
// which is what the crate's durability contract actually promises (see the durability section on
// `Sdk`), and a crash in the window between the two commits is repaired by
// `FederationInner::reconcile_operations`, which rebuilds a record from the log entry the module
// did commit. See fedimint/fedimint#9117 for the upstream change that would close the window;
// the note is deleted once it lands.

/// by a newer SDK can name a kind this build knows while using a state schema
/// it has never seen).
///
/// Four calls answer four different questions about a record:
/// [`kind`](AnyOperation::kind) says what it is and never
/// fails; [`support`](AnyOperation::support) says how far this build can go
/// with it and why no further, as a plain value for logs and bug reports;
/// [`supported_kind`](AnyOperation::supported_kind) is the gate to pass
/// before acting on the operation, returning
/// [`UnsupportedOperation`](crate::ErrorCode::UnsupportedOperation) when it
/// is not supported; and [`raw_kind`](AnyOperation::raw_kind) gives the
/// persisted discriminator verbatim, for logs and bug reports.
///
/// The seven `as_*` accessors return `Some` only when the kind matches and
/// the operation is supported, and `None` otherwise, without distinguishing
/// a plain kind mismatch from an unsupported record of the matching kind:
/// use [`support`](AnyOperation::support) or
/// [`supported_kind`](AnyOperation::supported_kind) first when the answer
/// matters, for example before showing an error to the user. This keeps a
/// caller from being handed a typed [`Operation`] whose state later fails to
/// decode from [`Operation::state`] instead of from this gate.
///
/// This determination is made before any state is read, so it is not a
/// promise that reading the state will succeed. A record whose schema is
/// unrecorded is treated as not ruled out. The residue, a record that passed
