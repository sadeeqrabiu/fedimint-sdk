//! The SDK's own records, and the byte layout that lets many federations share one store.
//!
//! The root keyspace is split by a one-byte tag:
//!
//! ```text
//! 0x00                              the SDK's own records (this module)
//! 0x01 ++ <32-byte federation id>   one federation's namespace, handed to fedimint-client
//! ```
//!
//! Both are fixed width, which matters because `Database::with_prefix` concatenates bytes with no
//! length delimiter: a variable-width tag could make one federation's keyspace start inside
//! another's. Inside a federation's namespace the SDK owns `0xb0..=0xcf`, which upstream reserves
//! for embedders; the operation records at `0xb0` arrive with the operation infrastructure.
//!
//! Every read and write here goes through the *raw* transaction ops. The typed ones
//! (`get_value`, `insert_entry`, `commit_tx`) call `.expect(..)` on a backend failure and on a
//! decode failure, and this crate reports storage trouble as `ErrorCode::Storage` rather than
//! taking the host application down with it.
