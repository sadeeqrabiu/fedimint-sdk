/// that can happen to the money. There is no failure state: if storage

/// that is a failure to *observe* the send, reported as `Err` from
/// [`Operation::state`](crate::Operation::state),
/// [`Operation::await_final`](crate::Operation::await_final) or
/// [`OperationUpdates::next`](crate::OperationUpdates::next), not a state
/// of the send itself. The send keeps running, unaffected by the fact that
/// nobody could see it: bearer notes out in the world can still be redeemed
/// or reclaimed long after some call failed to observe them. See
/// [`Sdk::forget_federation`](crate::Sdk::forget_federation), which refuses
/// while reclaimable outgoing value remains.
// Upstream `fedimint-mint-client` models this as `SpendOOBState`: `Created`,
// `UserCanceledProcessing`, `UserCanceledSuccess`, `UserCanceledFailure`, `Success`,
// `Refunded`. Two of those names mean the opposite of what they suggest read in
// isolation, since they are named from the point of view of the cancellation attempt
// rather than the send: `Success` means the automatic reclaim failed (the receiver
// redeemed), `Refunded` means the reclaim succeeded (the notes returned).
//

/// The true state of a mintv2 send, as far as it can be told at all.
///
/// Unlike `wallet`'s v1 mint, mintv2 gives an out-of-band send no state machine and no
/// subscription: `MintClientModule::send` extracts the notes from the balance synchronously and
/// returns, with nothing left running upstream to observe. There is also no automatic reclaim on
/// mintv2's side (its own doc comment on `send` says as much: "To cancel a successful ecash send
/// simply receive it yourself"). So before this operation's [`EcashSendDetails::reclaim_at`] and
/// absent an explicit [`request_cancel`](Operation::request_cancel), `Created` is not a guess,
/// it is the only honest answer: the notes are out and nothing more is knowable yet.
///
/// Past that point, this drives the client-side reclaim mintv2 expects the caller to perform:
/// attempting to receive the very ecash this operation sent. Attempting it is exactly as safe to
/// repeat as observing it, since `MintClientModule::receive` derives its operation id
/// deterministically from the ecash and treats a second attempt on the same ecash as the same
/// operation rather than a second submission.
///
/// - The receive lands (`FinalReceiveOperationState::Success`): this reclaim won the race, so the
///   value is back in the balance — [`EcashSendState::Canceled`].
/// - The federation rejects the claiming transaction (`FinalReceiveOperationState::Rejected`):
///   these notes are already spent, which can only mean the receiver got there first —
///   [`EcashSendState::Redeemed`]. This is the *only* signal that proves a redemption, because it
///   is the only one that comes back from consensus.
/// - `AlreadyReceived`: this is not the first time this reclaim was attempted (an earlier poll,
///   or an earlier process that crashed before observing the outcome); the earlier attempt's own
///   operation, found via the same deterministic id, is awaited instead of starting a second one.
///
/// Every other refusal, `InsufficientFunds` included, is a failure to *observe*, reported as
/// `Err` and left retryable — never a state. Upstream raises `InsufficientFunds` for any
/// `finalize_and_submit_transaction` failure that is not `AlreadyReceived`
/// (`fedimint-mintv2-client`'s `receive`), which covers local transaction construction and
/// commit failures — a database error, a transaction over the size limit — that happen before
/// the federation ever sees the notes and so prove nothing about whether they were redeemed.
/// Reporting one as [`Redeemed`](EcashSendState::Redeemed) would persist a final state and stop
/// the SDK ever reclaiming these notes again, turning a transient local fault into lost money.
