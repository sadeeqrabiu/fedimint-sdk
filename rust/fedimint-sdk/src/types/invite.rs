/// An invite code for a federation.
///
/// An invite code carries everything needed to locate and connect to a
/// federation's guardians before anything has been persisted locally. It is
/// opaque: callers pass it to a preview or join call rather than picking it
/// apart, with one deliberate exception:
/// [`federation_id`](InviteCode::federation_id), the key that every
/// per-federation call takes, is readable from the code without a network
/// round trip. It round-trips through [`Display`](core::fmt::Display) and
/// [`FromStr`](core::str::FromStr) with a validating parse, so it can be
/// entered as text, scanned from a QR code, or shared as a link and
/// reconstructed on the other end without any federation-specific parsing
/// logic outside this crate.
///
/// # `Display` prints the code, `Debug` never does
///
/// An invite code is not always public: it can embed an `api_secret`, the
/// credential a private federation requires before its guardians will answer
/// at all, so the code is a bearer credential and printing one can hand a
/// reader access to a federation meant to be closed.
/// [`Display`](core::fmt::Display) prints the code and is the deliberate way
/// to render, scan or share it. [`Debug`] is redacted instead, because it is
/// what logging, crash reporters and `assert!` failures reach for, and any
/// struct holding an `InviteCode` would otherwise print it merely by being
/// logged.
