/// An invite code for a federation.
///
/// An invite code carries everything needed to locate and connect to a
/// federation's guardians before anything has been persisted locally. It is
/// opaque: callers pass it to a preview or join call rather than picking it
/// apart, with one deliberate exception —
/// [`federation_id`](InviteCode::federation_id), the key that every
/// per-federation call takes, is readable from the code without a network
/// round trip. It round-trips through [`Display`](core::fmt::Display) and
/// [`FromStr`](core::str::FromStr) with a validating parse, so it can be
/// entered as text, scanned from a QR code, or shared as a link and
/// reconstructed on the other end without any federation-specific parsing
/// logic outside this crate.
///
/// # `Display` prints the code, `Debug` never does
///
/// An invite code is not always public. It can embed an `api_secret`, which
/// is the credential a private federation requires before its guardians will
/// answer at all — so the code is a bearer credential, and printing one can
/// hand a reader access to a federation that was meant to be closed. The two
/// formatting traits are therefore split deliberately:
///
/// - **[`Display`](core::fmt::Display) is the escape hatch**, and it is the
///   only one. Rendering the code is what the type is for — it has to be
///   shown, scanned, and shared — so `{invite}` is a visible, deliberate
///   choice, the same way [`Mnemonic::words`](crate::Mnemonic::words) is the
///   deliberate way to get a seed phrase out.
/// - **[`Debug`] is not an escape hatch** and is redacted. `{:?}` is what
///   logging, crash reporters, tracing spans, and `assert!` failure messages
///   reach for, none of which should receive a credential nobody chose to
///   publish. Derived `Debug` would also leak *transitively*: any struct
///   holding an `InviteCode` and deriving `Debug` would print it merely by
///   being logged, without anyone formatting the code on purpose.
