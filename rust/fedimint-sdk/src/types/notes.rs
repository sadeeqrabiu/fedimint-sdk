/// federation context for a receiver to redeem them. It is opaque: callers
/// treat it as a value to display, copy, transmit, and hand to a receive
/// call, not as something to parse apart. It round-trips through
/// [`Display`](core::fmt::Display) and [`FromStr`](core::str::FromStr) with a
/// validating parse.
///
/// Notes obtained from a sender should be redeemed promptly: unredeemed
/// notes that a sender created are subject to that sender's automatic
/// reclaim policy, after which they stop being redeemable.
///
/// # `Display` prints the notes, `Debug` never does
///
/// This value **is** the money: anyone holding the string can redeem it, so
/// it is a bearer instrument in exactly the way a banknote is.
/// [`Display`](core::fmt::Display) prints the notes and is the deliberate,
/// visible way to get the value out. [`Debug`] is redacted instead, because
/// it is what logging, crash reporters and `assert!` failures reach for, and
/// a struct holding a `Notes` (such as [`EcashSend`](crate::EcashSend))
/// would otherwise print the token merely by being logged.
