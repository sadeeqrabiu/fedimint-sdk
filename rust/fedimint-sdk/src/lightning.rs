/// verifying that the chosen gateway is actually reachable and willing,

/// invoice is created or a payment is funded, so a class of failures that
/// used to appear halfway through an operation is instead an error from

    ///
    /// Quoting is a separate step from paying because the numbers a user
    /// must approve — the fee, the total debit, which gateway will carry
    /// the payment — are only knowable after the SDK has picked and
    /// verified a route. The returned [`LnQuote`] is that plan, frozen: it
    /// binds the invoice, the amount the invoice names, the selected and
    /// verified gateway (or the discovery that no gateway is needed at all),
    /// the aggregate fee, the total debit, and the federation configuration
    /// those were computed against. Show it, then hand it back to
    /// [`Lightning::send`] to execute exactly what was shown. A user cannot
    /// be quoted one fee and charged another.
    ///

    /// parameter, and the section below is why.

    ///
    /// # An amountless invoice is refused, and no amount can rescue it
    ///
    /// An invoice that names no amount fails here with
    /// [`AmountlessInvoice`](crate::ErrorCode::AmountlessInvoice), and there
    /// is deliberately nowhere to supply an amount instead. Fedimint does not
    /// support paying amountless bolt11 invoices: that is a **permanent
    /// upstream position**, confirmed as something that cannot be implemented
    /// safely, and both the v1 and the lnv2 payment paths reject such an
    /// invoice outright. It is not a gap in this SDK that a later release
    /// fills.
    ///
    /// So a payer-supplied amount could never make such an invoice payable,
    /// and a parameter for one would be a permanently-unusable argument in
    /// every generated binding — always null in Swift, Kotlin and
    /// TypeScript, with no value for it that changes the outcome. The way an
    /// application declines the invoice with a useful message is to look
    /// before it quotes:
    /// [`Bolt11Invoice::amount`](crate::Bolt11Invoice::amount) returning
    /// `None` is exactly the invoice this call refuses, and "this invoice
    /// does not specify an amount and cannot be paid here" is a better thing
    /// to show than a failed quote.
    ///
    /// # This is where the network is checked
    ///
    /// The invoice's currency — and therefore the Bitcoin network it is
    /// denominated for — is compared against the federation's
    /// ([`Federation::network`](crate::Federation::network)) here, and a
    /// disagreement fails with
    /// [`NetworkMismatch`](crate::ErrorCode::NetworkMismatch). The comparison
    /// is by BOLT11 currency class rather than exact network, because that
    /// is all an invoice can say: the `tb` currency covers testnet3 and
    /// testnet4 alike, so a `tb` invoice is compatible with a federation on
    /// either, and a federation on
    /// [`Network::Testnet4`](crate::Network::Testnet4) issues `tb` invoices
    /// of its own. The structured
    /// [`ErrorDetails::NetworkMismatch`](crate::ErrorDetails::NetworkMismatch)
    /// carries the federation's network as `expected`, every network the
    /// invoice could have been for as `compatible` — one entry for a
    /// currency that pins the network, two for `tb` — and the currency
    /// prefix itself as `observed_prefix`, so a caller can name them without
    /// parsing the message.
    ///
    /// Quoting is the deterministic place for that check: every payment
    /// passes through it, it happens before anything is committed, and the
    /// answer does not depend on which gateway is picked or which module
    /// generation serves the payment. lnv2 has its own `WrongCurrency`
    /// failure downstream of here, but relying on it would mean discovering
    /// the mismatch mid-payment on one generation and not at all on the

///
/// - **`LnPayState`** (v1 lightning, gateway-routed):  `Created`,
///   `Canceled`, `Funded { block_height }`, `WaitingForRefund { error_reason }`,
///   `AwaitingChange`, `Success { preimage }`, `Refunded { gateway_error }`,
///   `UnexpectedError { error_message }`.
/// - **`InternalPayState`** (v1 lightning, payee in the same federation,
///   selected by `PayType::Internal`): `Funding`, `Preimage(..)`,
///   `RefundSuccess { .. }`, `RefundError { .. }`, `FundingFailed { .. }`,
///   `UnexpectedError(..)`.
/// - **`SendOperationState`** (lnv2): `Funding`, `Funded`, `Success`,
///   `Refunding`, `Refunded`, `Failure`.
///
/// Which of the first two applies is decided upstream by `PayType`, and it
/// is exactly the distinction [`LightningRoute`] exposes — a caller
/// following an internal payment and a caller following a gateway payment
/// are watching structurally different upstream machines today. Collapsing
/// them here is the point: an application should not have to write two
/// payment screens because the payee happened to be in the same
/// federation, and it should not have to be rewritten when lnv2 replaces
/// v1 underneath.
///
/// The collapse maps funding-in-progress states onto
/// [`Created`](Self::Created) and [`Funded`](Self::Funded), all the
/// preimage-obtained states onto [`Success`](Self::Success), everything
/// that ends with the funds spendable again onto
/// [`Refunded`](Self::Refunded), and only a refund that itself failed, or
/// an error nobody resolved, onto [`Failed`](Self::Failed). That last line
/// is drawn by what happened to the money, not by what upstream named the
/// state — the distinction this enum's own variants make is that
/// [`Refunded`](Self::Refunded) means the funds are safe and
/// [`Failed`](Self::Failed) means the operation did not resolve into a
/// clean return.
///
/// The preimage those success states carry is normalised on the way
/// through: v1 reports it as a hex string and lnv2 reports it as raw bytes,
/// and both arrive at a caller as one [`Preimage`].
///
/// Four upstream variants fall outside a one-to-one reading of those
/// buckets, and are called out rather than left to be discovered:
///
/// - **`LnPayState::Canceled`.** The payment was called off before the
///   gateway took it on, so the funds never left and no refund was needed.
///   Nothing was paid, so it is not [`Success`](Self::Success); the money is
///   in the balance, which is exactly what [`Refunded`](Self::Refunded)
///   promises, so that is where it lands. There is no `Canceled` variant
///   here: an outgoing payment offers no cancellation to a caller of this
///   SDK (the only cancellation in the crate is
///   [`Operation::request_cancel`](crate::Operation::request_cancel) for
///   out-of-band ecash), so a distinct variant would name something no
///   application could ever have asked for.
/// - **`InternalPayState::FundingFailed`**, and **lnv2's `Failure` when it
///   follows `Funding` directly.** Both are the federation rejecting the
///   funding transaction: the notes were never spent, so nothing left the
///   balance and nothing needs refunding. Safe funds are
///   [`Refunded`](Self::Refunded), as for `Canceled` above, and not
///   [`Failed`](Self::Failed) — the operation did resolve cleanly, into no
///   effect. lnv2 reports this `Failure` and the one below through the same
///   public variant, so the implementation keys on whether the payment had
///   reached [`Funded`](Self::Funded) — a `Failure` before it is a
///   rejection, one after it is a refund that failed — and persists that
///   phase, exactly as [`LnReceiveState`] requires of a receive.
/// - **lnv2's `Failure` after `Refunding`.** The refund transaction was
///   rejected and no preimage turned up either, so the money is neither
///   paid nor back: [`Failed`](Self::Failed), the case that variant exists
///   for.
/// - **lnv2's `SendOperationState::Refunding`.** A refund that is *in
///   progress*, not one that completed — the money is neither paid nor back
///   yet. It is therefore **not final**, and maps onto
///   [`Funded`](Self::Funded), the crate's other non-final in-flight state,
///   rather than onto [`Refunded`](Self::Refunded), which promises the funds
///   are already spendable again. A subscriber sees it as the payment still
///   running and then the terminal [`Refunded`](Self::Refunded) when the
///   refund lands.
///
/// Because these are judgements about which upstream distinctions matter to
/// an application rather than a one-to-one mapping, this variant set is
/// provisional and will be reconciled against the lightning client when this
/// facade is implemented.
///
/// # An obligation this enum places on the implementation
///
/// [`Success`](Self::Success) carries the fee and the route. **Neither is
/// available from the v1 upstream progress stream.** Upstream reports a fee
/// exactly once, synchronously, as the `fee` field of the
/// `OutgoingLightningPayment` returned when the payment is initiated — and
/// that field is only the gateway's cut, not the whole debit
/// ([`LnQuote::fee`] is) — and it does not put the gateway id into the
/// pay-state stream at all. So the SDK must capture both from the quote it
/// executed and carry them forward itself. [`LnSendDetails`] is where they
/// are persisted, in the same write that creates the operation, which is what
/// makes them survive a restart and stay readable for a
/// [`Refunded`](Self::Refunded) or [`Failed`](Self::Failed) payment as well
/// as a successful one. That is a real obligation on whoever implements this

/// The lifecycle of an incoming lightning payment.
///
/// # Relationship to the upstream state machine
///
/// Upstream v1's `LnReceiveState` is `Created`,
/// `WaitingForPayment { invoice, timeout }`, `Canceled { reason }`,
/// `Funded`, `AwaitingFunds`, `Claimed`. This enum tracks it closely: the
/// invoice and timeout that upstream attaches to `WaitingForPayment` are
/// persisted in [`LnReceiveDetails`] instead, as
/// [`invoice`](LnReceiveDetails::invoice) and
/// [`expires_at`](LnReceiveDetails::expires_at), so
/// [`WaitingForPayment`](Self::WaitingForPayment) carries no payload, and
/// upstream's `AwaitingFunds` is folded into [`Funded`](Self::Funded) —
/// both mean "paid, settling".
///
/// That the record is where they live, rather than the value
/// [`Lightning::receive`] returned, is the point: both are fixed when the
/// invoice is created and neither ever changes, so re-delivering them on
/// every transition would copy the same bytes to every subscriber for
/// nothing (placement-rule case 1) — while a caller that never held the
/// returned [`LnReceive`], or that is running again after a restart, still
/// reads them from the operation's id alone.
///
/// [`Expired`](Self::Expired) and [`Failed`](Self::Failed) are additions, and
/// between them they are why a v1 terminal cancellation cannot be mapped by
/// its upstream variant alone.
///
/// [`Expired`](Self::Expired) exists because an invoice that simply lapses
/// unpaid is the most common way a receive ends and is not a failure worth
/// alarming a user about. v1 has no dedicated variant for it and reports it as
/// a cancellation whose reason is a timeout; lnv2 has an explicit expired
/// state. Splitting it out lets an application render "this invoice expired"
/// as its own outcome.
///
/// [`Failed`](Self::Failed) exists because a receive can get past "nobody
/// paid" and still not end in a credit: a payment can arrive and then fail
/// to become spendable ecash, or the protocol can go wrong on a contract that
/// was funded, unwinding the payment before anyone was paid. Neither is
/// [`Canceled`](Self::Canceled), which this enum reserves for a receive that
/// ended before anything was funded, nor [`Claimed`](Self::Claimed), which
/// would assert the funds are spendable when they are not.
///
/// # The v1 mapping is keyed on the reason, and for one reason on the phase
///
/// v1's cancellation reason is **typed, not free-form**: upstream's
/// `LnReceiveState::Canceled` carries a `LightningReceiveError`, whose variants
/// are `Timeout`, `Rejected`, `ClaimRejected` and `InvalidPreimage`. No string
/// is parsed anywhere in this mapping, and none needs to be.
///
/// Three of the four reasons map on their own. The fourth, `Rejected`, is
/// emitted at two entirely different moments: for the transaction that
/// registers the invoice being refused before anybody paid, and again after
/// a claim had been accepted but the primary-module outputs failed to
/// produce notes. The first means nothing happened; the second means
/// somebody paid and the money did not arrive. For that one reason the
/// mapping key is the pair **(reason, phase the operation had reached)**,
/// where the phase that matters is whether the receive had ever reached
/// [`Funded`](Self::Funded) — that is, whether a payment had been confirmed
/// for it.
///
/// | upstream v1 | phase reached | here |
/// | --- | --- | --- |
/// | `Created` | — | [`Created`](Self::Created) |
/// | `WaitingForPayment { .. }` | — | [`WaitingForPayment`](Self::WaitingForPayment) |
/// | `Funded`, `AwaitingFunds` | — | [`Funded`](Self::Funded) |
/// | `Claimed` | — | [`Claimed`](Self::Claimed) |
/// | `Canceled { Timeout }` | any | [`Expired`](Self::Expired) |
/// | `Canceled { ClaimRejected }` | any | [`Funded`](Self::Funded), reclaiming; see rule 2 |
/// | `Canceled { InvalidPreimage }` | any | [`Failed`](Self::Failed) |
/// | `Canceled { Rejected }` | before [`Funded`](Self::Funded) | [`Canceled`](Self::Canceled) |
/// | `Canceled { Rejected }` | at or after [`Funded`](Self::Funded) | [`Failed`](Self::Failed) |
///
/// Three rules generate the whole table, and they are what an implementation
/// should encode:
///
/// 1. `Timeout` is [`Expired`](Self::Expired). Nobody paid within the
///    invoice's lifetime; that is the benign ending.
/// 2. `ClaimRejected` and `InvalidPreimage` are never a pre-payment
///    cancellation, whatever phase the operation shows. Both presuppose a
///    funded contract — a claim is only attempted for one, and a preimage
///    is only decrypted for one — but they end differently. `InvalidPreimage`
///    unwinds the payment (see [`Failed`](Self::Failed)) and is
///    [`Failed`](Self::Failed) outright. `ClaimRejected` is **not final**:
///    the payment is confirmed and still locked to this wallet, so the
///    receive moves to [`Funded`](Self::Funded) and stays there while the
///    reclaim below runs. The phase cannot be consulted for either, and must
///    not be: upstream reports its own `Funded` only once the claim
///    transaction has been accepted, so both of these reasons arrive
///    *before* it, on a receive still showing
///    [`WaitingForPayment`](Self::WaitingForPayment). Reading that as a
///    pre-payment cancellation would be exactly wrong.
/// 3. `Rejected` is [`Canceled`](Self::Canceled) on a receive that never got
///    past [`WaitingForPayment`](Self::WaitingForPayment) — a genuine refusal
///    before payment, with nothing owed to anyone — and
///    [`Failed`](Self::Failed) on one that had reached
///    [`Funded`](Self::Funded), where it is the claim's primary outputs
///    failing after a payment was confirmed.
///
/// **Rule 3 obliges the implementation to persist the phase.** The terminal
/// upstream event does not say which moment it belongs to, and after a restart
/// the SDK is not the process that watched the operation, so "did this receive
/// ever reach [`Funded`](Self::Funded)?" must be durable rather than
/// remembered. Without it a post-claim failure and a pre-payment refusal are
/// indistinguishable, which is precisely the bug this mapping fixes. The
/// amounts on [`LnReceiveDetails`] are not a substitute: they answer what the
/// receive was for, not how far it got.
///
/// **Rule 2 obliges the implementation not to give up early.** A rejected
/// claim is not the end of the payment: the contract is funded, still locked
/// to this wallet's key, and the lightning client offers a reclaim for
/// exactly that case. So `ClaimRejected` moves the receive to
/// [`Funded`](Self::Funded) — a payment is confirmed — and the SDK drives the
/// reclaim under the same operation id, whatever operation identity the
/// underlying client gives the attempt, until the receive is
/// [`Claimed`](Self::Claimed) or the reclaim itself fails and
/// [`Failed`](Self::Failed) is the truth. [`Failed`](Self::Failed) is
/// terminal, so it is only emitted once no further claim is possible; an
/// application never sees a still-claimable payment finalised, and so never
/// sees one pass the guards on
/// [`Sdk::forget_federation`](crate::Sdk::forget_federation).
///
/// lnv2 needs no phase arbitration, because it draws the pre-payment
/// distinction itself: its `ReceiveOperationState` has explicit pending and
/// claiming states, mapping onto
/// [`WaitingForPayment`](Self::WaitingForPayment) and
/// [`Funded`](Self::Funded); its claimed state maps onto
/// [`Claimed`](Self::Claimed); and its expired state onto
/// [`Expired`](Self::Expired). Rule 2 applies to it unchanged, though: a
/// `Failure` after the claim transaction was accepted and its outputs failed
/// to become notes is [`Failed`](Self::Failed), while a claim the federation
/// rejects with the contract still claimable keeps the receive
/// [`Funded`](Self::Funded) and drives the reclaim, exactly as for v1.
/// Whether the lightning client reports those two as one state or two is its
/// business; this contract is the same either way.
///
/// Because those splits are judgements rather than a one-to-one mapping,
/// this variant set is provisional and will be reconciled against the
/// lightning client when this facade is implemented.
